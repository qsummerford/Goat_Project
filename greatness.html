    <p class='text_box'>What makes Naruto so great is his Talk-no-jutsu. His talk-no-jutsu happens when he is fighting an opponent. If his opponent is on the same wavelength as him, they can talk by fighting. Sometimes it is just straight through talking. Naruto has the ability to turn someone from being evil to turning them good. The villian can relate to Naruto and see that he turned out good and not evil like them.</p>
